![Uploading vehicle-detection-using-opencv-5-1652641191.gifâ€¦]()

This project is about computer vision technology using to detect number of cars on highway.vision and image processing. It can be used to analyze images and video footage from cameras and other sources, and it has many applications in highway traffic management. Some ways that OpenCV can be used in this field include:

Object detection: OpenCV can be used to detect objects in images or video footage, such as vehicles, pedestrians, and bicycles. This can be used to monitor traffic flow and detect accidents or congestion.

Lane detection: OpenCV can be used to detect the lane markings on a road, which can be used to determine if a vehicle is drifting out of its lane or if a lane change is necessary.

Traffic sign detection: OpenCV can be used to detect and recognize traffic signs, such as speed limit signs or stop signs. This can be used to alert drivers to upcoming hazards or to enforce traffic laws.

Vehicle tracking: OpenCV can be used to track the movement of vehicles, which can be useful for traffic flow analysis, accident investigation, and surveillance.

Automated toll collection: OpenCV can be used to capture images of license plates and identify the corresponding vehicles. This can be used for automated toll collection, which can improve traffic flow and reduce congestion.
